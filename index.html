    <h1>About Assocify</h1>
    <div class="dotted-line"></div>
    <section class="container">
      <p><b>Assocify</b> is a Discord app created by talchao that associates messages with songs, gifs, etc.</p>
      <p>In servers, Assocify checks messages sent by users for keywords and responds with related links. Additionally, commands such as <code>/song</code> and <code>/media</code> can be run in servers and DMs alike with a limited selection of options. To use Assocify commands in direct messages, the Assocify app must first be added to the user's Discord account. If you would like to install the app: click <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1402686916247293953" about="_blank">here</a>, then select "Add to My Apps".</p>
      <p>Note that this app is not intended for most servers, as the selection of items that Assocify links are primarily tailored to talchao's interests — this is just a silly bot created primarily for personal use. Moreover, Assocify is hosted on talchao's PC, meaning Assocify will be unavailable while they are offline.</p>
      <p>Feel free to leave any recommendations for associations in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830252540649275392/1151256248902221936" about="_blank">#suggestions</a> on the Minecraft Prom Discord server. Suggestions will be added at talchao's discretion, as there are select other servers that use Assocify.</p>
